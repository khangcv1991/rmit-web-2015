									<br>In 1989, scientist Hank Pym resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. after
										discovering their attempt to replicate his Ant-Man shrinking
										technology. Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to
										hide it as long as he lives. In the present day, Pym's
										estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne, and former protégé, Darren
										Cross, have forced him out of his own company. Cross is close
										to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket,
										which horrifies Pym.<br>
									<br>Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief Scott Lang
										moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. While visiting his
										daughter Cassie unannounced, Lang is rebuked by his former
										wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not
										providing child support. Unable to hold a job because of his
										criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a
										burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but
										only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit,
										which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang
										accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect.
										Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house,
										but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits
										Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him
										break out.<br>
									<br>At his home, Pym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing
										Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become
										the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having
										been spying on Cross for Pym despite her strained relationship
										with her father, van Dyne helps Pym train Lang to fight and to
										control ants. They send him to steal a device from the
										Avengers' headquarters, where he briefly fights Sam Wilson.
										While van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother
										Janet's death, he reveals that Janet, known as the Wasp,
										disappeared into a subatomic quantum realm to disable a Soviet
										nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar
										fate if he overrides his suit's regulator.<br>
									<br>Cross perfects the Yellowjacket and hosts an unveiling
										ceremony at his headquarters. Lang, along with his crew and a
										swarm of flying ants, infiltrates the building during the
										event, sabotages the company's servers, and plants explosives.
										When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym
										and Hope, are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the
										Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to Hydra, led by former
										S.H.I.E.L.D officer Mitchell Carson. Lang breaks free and he
										and Hope dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though Carson is
										able to flee with a vial of Cross' particles. Lang pursues
										Cross as he escapes, while the explosives detonate, imploding
										the building.<br>
									<br>Cross dons the Yellowjacket and attacks Lang before Lang is
										arrested by Paxton. His mind addled by the imperfect shrinking
										technology, Cross takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into
										another fight. Lang overrides the regulator and shrinks to
										subatomic size to penetrate Cross' suit and sabotage it to
										shrink uncontrollably, killing Cross. Lang disappears into the
										quantum realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns
										to the macroscopic world. In gratitude for Lang's heroism,
										Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison. Seeing that
										Lang survived and returned from the quantum realm, Pym wonders
										if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis,
										who tells him that Wilson is looking for him.<br>
									<br>In a mid-credits scene, Pym shows van Dyne a new Wasp
										prototype suit and offers it to her. In a post-credits scene,
										Wilson and Steve Rogers have Bucky Barnes in their custody.
										Unable to contact Tony Stark because of "the accords", Wilson
										mentions that he knows someone who could help.

									After spending two decades in England, Bill Bryson returns to
									the U.S., where he decides the best way to connect with his
									homeland is to hike the Appalachian Trail <span
										class="hide-text">with one of his oldest friends.<br>
									<br>[plot]The author Bill Bryson (Robert Redford) after living
										for two decades in Britain, has returned to New Hampshire,
										where he's been living peacefully for the past ten years. He's
										now in his late 50s or early 60s. An interview on TV reveals
										that he has published several popular books and that there are
										expectations that he will be writing more. But he has no such
										plans.<br>
									<br>He is not an outgoing person, which becomes obvious at a
										funeral he attends with his wife. After the funeral he takes a
										stroll nearby on the Appalachian Trail, and he decides then
										and there to hike it. His wife (Emma Thompson) objects and
										presents him with all kinds of reports of accidents and
										murders that have happened on the trail. Finally, however, she
										gives in on the condition that he doesn't go alone. He agrees
										and searches for one among his friends who might be willing to
										join him. Everyone he calls declines the invitation; some
										declare him insane. Then he receives a phone call from a
										former friend, Stephen Katz (Nick Nolte), who offers himself
										as hiking companion. Despite appearances, Stephen claims to be
										fit enough to take the challenge.<br>
									<br>Bill's wife is again not happy, this time with his choice
										of hiking companion, but relents.<br>
									<br>Within less than a mile of their starting point, as groups
										of hikers overtake and pass them, they begin to grasp the
										difficulty of their ambition. Shortly after, a group of young
										children effortlessly runs by them up the trail, laughing and
										calling out to each other. But seeing others pass them by so
										easily gives them the motivation to carry on. And so they move
										on, day by day, making more or less pleasant acquaintances,
										having more or less pleasant experiences, eventually trekking
										into a section signed " for experienced hikers only". While
										maneuvering heavy awkward backpacks alongside a precipitous
										drop, Bill trips and pulls Stephen with him down a steep rocky
										cliff. They fall about five meters onto a ledge spacious
										enough to be comfortable, but far enough below the trail to be
										unable to get back up to resume the hike. They must spend the
										night there with no clear hope of rescue. Luckily, the next
										day they are woken by early morning hikers who are able to get
										them off the ledge. Onward...<br>
									<br>Some period of time later they reach a hut, having been
										hiking miserably through the pouring rain. Carved into the log
										wall there is an AT map that shows the trail and their
										location. They realize then that they have finished only about
										one third of the trail but have already spent three months on
										it.<br>
									<br>Eventually they decide they've had enough and return back
										home.<br>
									<br>At the end, now comfortably back at home, Bill is going
										through his mail when he finds a series of post cards written
										by Stephen and mailed from their pit stops along the way. The
										last one says: "What's next?' Bill sits down, opens his laptop
										and begins typing: "A WALK IN THE WOODS"
